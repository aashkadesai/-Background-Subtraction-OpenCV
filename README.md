# -Background-Subtraction-OpenCV
This project implements background subtraction using OpenCV's BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 algorithm. It processes a video to isolate foreground objects by replacing the background with a solid color. The project explores key concepts in motion segmentation, computer vision, and real-time object detection.
